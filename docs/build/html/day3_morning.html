<p>On day 1, we ran through a pipeline to map reads against a reference genome and call variants, but didn’t do much with the variants we identified. Among the most common analyses to perform on a set of variants is to construct phylogenetic trees. Here we will explore different tools for generating and visualizing phylogenetic trees, and also see how recombination can distort phylogenetic signal.</p>
<p>For the first several exercises, we will use the A. baumannii genomes that we worked with yesterday afternoon.
The backstory on these genomes is that Abau_A, Abau_B and Abau_C are representatives of three clones (as defined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis - a low-resolution typing method) that were circulating in our hospital.</p>
<p>One of the goals of our published study was to understand the relationship among these clones to discern whether:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li>the three clones represent three independent introductions into the hospital or</li>
<li>the three clones originated from a single introduction into the hospital, with subsequent genomic rearrangement leading to the appearance of unique clones.</li>
</ol>
<p>The types of phylogenetic analyses you will be performing here are the same types that we used to decipher this mystery.
The other two genomes you will be using are ACICU and AB0057. ACICU is an isolate from a hospital in France, and its close relationship to our isolates makes it a good reference for comparison. AB0057 is a more distantly related isolate that we will utilize as an out-group in our phylogenetic analysis. The utility of an out-group is to help us root our phylogenetic tree, and gain a more nuanced understanding of the relationship among strains.</p>
<p>Execute the following command to copy files for this afternoon’s exercises to your scratch directory:</p>

<p>An alternative approach for identification of variants among genomes is to perform whole genome alignments of assemblies. If the original short read data is unavailable, this might be the only approach available to you. Typically, these programs don’t scale well to large numbers of genomes (e.g. &gt; 100), but they are worth being familiar with. We will use the tool mauve for constructing whole genome alignments of our five A. baumannii genomes.</p>

<p>There are lots of options for phylogenetic analysis. Here, we will use the ape package in R to look at our multiple alignments and construct a tree using the Neighbor Joining method.</p>

</pre>
<blockquote>
<div>iii. Get variable positions</div></blockquote>
<p>The DNA object created by read.dna can also be addressed as a matrix, where the columns are positions in the alignment and rows are your sequences. We will next treat our alignment as a matrix, and use apply and colSums to get positions in the alignment that vary among our sequences. Examine these commands in detail to understand how they are working together to give you a logical vector indicating which positions vary in your alignment.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

</pre>
<blockquote>
<div>v. Count number of variants between sequences</div></blockquote>
<p>Now that we know which positions in the alignment are core and variable, we can extract these positions and count how many variants there are among our genomes. Do count pairwise variants we will use the dist.dna function in ape. The model parameter indicates that we want to compare sequences by counting differences. Print out the resulting matrix to see how different our genomes are.</p>

<blockquote>
<div>vi. Construct phylogenetic tree</div></blockquote>
<p>Now we are ready to construct our first phylogenetic tree!</p>
<p>We are going to use the Neighbor Joining algorithm, which takes a matrix of pairwise distances among the input sequences and produces the tree with the minimal total distance. In essence, you can think of this as a distance-based maximum parsimony algorithm, with the advantage being that it runs way faster than if you were to apply a standard maximum parsimony phylogenetic reconstruction.</p>
<p>As a first step we are going to build a more accurate distance matrix, where instead of counting variants, we will measure nucleotide distance using the Jukes-Cantor model of sequence evolution. This is the simplest model of sequence evolution, with a single mutation rate assumed for all types of nucleotide changes.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
dna_dist_JC = dist.dna(abau_msa, model = &quot;JC&quot;)
</pre>
<p>Next, we will use the ape function nj to build our tree from the distance matrix</p>

<p>An often-overlooked aspect of a proper phylogenetic analysis is to exclude recombinant sequences. Homologous recombination in bacterial genomes is a mode of horizontal transfer, wherein genomic DNA is taken up and swapped in for a homologous sequence. The reason it is critical to account for these recombinant regions is that these horizontally acquired sequences do not represent the phylogenetic history of the strain of interest, but rather in contains information regarding the strain in which the sequence was acquired from. One simple approach for detecting the presence of recombination is to look at the density of variants across a genome. The existence of unusually high or low densities of variants is suggestive that these regions of aberrant density were horizontally acquired. Here we will look at our closely related A. baumannii genomes to see if there is evidence of aberrant variant densities.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>i. Subset sequences to exclude the out-group</div></blockquote>
<p>For this analysis we want to exclude the out-group, because we are interested in determining whether recombination would hamper our ability to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationship among our closely related set of genomes.</p>

<p>Now that we know there is recombination, we know that we need to filter out the recombinant regions to discern the true phylogenetic relationship among our strains. In fact, this is such an extreme case (~99% of variants of recombinant), that we could be totally misled without filtering recombinant regions. To accomplish this we will use the tool gubbins, which essentially relies on elevated regions of variant density to perform recombination filtering.</p>

USA300 is a strain of growing concern, as it has been observed to cause infections in both hospitals and in otherwise healthy individuals in the community. An open question is whether there are sub-clades of USA300 in the hospital and the community, or if they are all the same. Here you will create an annotated phylogenetic tree of strains from the community and the hospital, to discern if these form distinct clusters.</p>

<div>vi. Add annotations to tree</div></blockquote>
<p>One of the most powerful features of iTOL is its ability to overlay diverse types of descriptive meta-data on your tree (http://itol.embl.de/help.cgi#datasets). Here, we will overlay our data on whether an isolate was from a community or hospital infection. To do this simply drag-and-drop the annotation file (2016-3-9_KP_BSI_USA300_iTOL_HA_vs_CA.txt) on your tree and voila!</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Do community and hospital isolates cluster together, or are they inter-mixed?</div></blockquote>
